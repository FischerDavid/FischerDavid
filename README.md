## About Me
My day job is primarily focued on leading people and managing infrastructure.  In my personal life, I've been a fulltime Linux user since 2015 and enjoy coding (mostly C++, sometimes rust).  I'm looking to contribute back to open source where I can and to meet others working in the space.
